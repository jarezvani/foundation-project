## What I used to develop this page

  

  ### 1. What technologies used and why 

    The frontend framework I chose to build this page was Zurb Foundation 6. I chose Foundation for its simple and flexible grid system, as well as other useful pre-packaged features such as Orbit (a slide carousel) and Reveal (quick way to integrate modal windows into the page.)

  ### 2. Any struggles faced when developing with technology chosen

    Using a frontend framework in general can be somewhat restrictive, and it might be easier just to use smaller libraries for individual features (like one just for a grid, etc). Overall, the benefit of having the consistency of a framework I found to be beneficial here, but next time I would probably use individual libraries to integrate these features more efficiently.

  ### 3. What I enjoyed the most

    I enjoyed the challenge of developing a page using modern designs and getting practice staying sharp with my CSS and HTML skills.
